## Display the flights dataset in an alternative format to simply printing it (i.e. running flights).

```{r}
#| echo: false
library(nycflights13)
library(dplyr)
library(tibble)
print(flights)
```

## Rewrite this code using dplyr and the pipe:

```{r}
dist_tbl <- flights |>
  filter(month == 1) |>
  group_by(carrier) |>
  summarise(
    mean_distance = mean(distance),
    sd_distance = sd(distance),
    .groups = "drop"
  ) |>
  arrange(mean_distance)
dist_tbl
```
